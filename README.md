# GPU Performance API
---
The GPU Performance API (GPUPerfAPI, or GPA) is a powerful library which provides access to GPU Performance Counters.
It can help analyze the performance and execution characteristics of applications using a Radeon™ GPU. This library
is used by [Radeon GPU Profiler](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/radeon_gpu_profiler) as well as several third-party tools.

## Documentation
The documentation for GPUPerfAPI can be found in each [GitHub release](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/gpu_performance_api/releases). In the release .zip file or .tgz file, there
will be a "docs" directory. Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to view the documentation.

The documentation is hosted publicly at: http://gpuperfapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Raw Hardware Counters
This release exposes both "Derived" counters and "Raw Hardware" counters. Derived counters are counters that are computed using a set of raw hardware counters.
This version allows you to access the raw hardware counters by simply specifying a flag when calling GpaOpenContext.

## Known Issues
### Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Vulkan ICD Issue
On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Vulkan ICD may not be set to use AMD Vulkan ICD. In this case, it needs to be explicitly set to use AMD Vulkan ICD before using the GPA. It can be done by setting the ```VK_ICD_FILENAMES``` environment variable to ```/etc/vulkan/icd.d/amd_icd64.json```.

### OpenGL FetchSize Counter on Radeon RX 6000 Series GPUs
FetchSize counter will show an error when enabled on Radeon RX 6000 Series GPUs using OpenGL.

### Adjusting Linux Clock Mode
Adjusting the GPU clock mode on Linux is accomplished by writing to: ```/sys/class/drm/card\<N\>/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level```, where \<N\> is the index of the card in question.

By default this file is only modifiable by root, so the application being profiled would have to be run as root in order for it to modify the clock mode. It is possible to modify the permissions for the file instead so that it can be written by unprivileged users. The following command will achieve this: ```sudo chmod ugo+w /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_force_performance_level```
* Note that changing the permissions on a system file like this could circumvent security.
* On multi-GPU systems you may have to replace "card0" with the appropriate card number.
* You may have to reboot the system for the change to take effect.
* Setting the GPU clock mode is not working correctly for <b>Radeon 5700 Series GPUs</b>, potentially leading to some inconsistencies in counter values from one run to the next.

### DirectX11 Performance Counter Accuracy For Select Counters and GPUs
The following performance counter values may not be accurate for DirectX 11 applications running on a Radeon 5700, and 6000 Series GPUs:
* VALUInstCount, SALUInstCount, VALUBusy, SALUBusy for all shader stages: These values should be representative of performance, but may not be 100% accurate.
* Most of the ComputeShader counters (all except the MemUnit and WriteUnit counters): These values should be representative of performance, but may not be 100% accurate.

### OpenCL Performance Counter Accuracy For Radeon 6000 Series GPUs
The following performance counter values may not be accurate for OpenCL applications running on Radeon 6000 Series GPUs:
* Wavefronts, VALUInsts, SALUInsts, SALUBusy, VALUUtilization: These values should be representative of performance, but may not be 100% accurate.

### OpenGL Performance Counter Accuracy For Radeon 5700 Series GPUs
The following performance counter values may not be accurate for OpenGL applications running on a Radeon 5700 Series GPUs:
* Most of the ComputeShader counters (all except the MemUnit and WriteUnit counters): These values should be representative of performance, but may not be 100% accurate.

### Variability in Deterministic Counters For Select GPUs
Performance counters which should be deterministic are showing variability on Radeon 5700 and 6000 Series GPUs. The values should be useful for performance analysis, but may not be 100% correct.
* e.g. VSVerticesIn, PrimitivesIn, PSPixelsOut, PreZSamplesPassing

### Profiling Bundles
Profiling bundles in DirectX12 and Vulkan is not working properly. It is recommended to remove those GPA Samples from your application, or move the calls out of the bundle for profiling.

## Style and Format Change
The source code of this product is being reformatted to follow the Google C++ Style Guide https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html.
In the interim you may encounter a mix of both an older C++ coding style, as well as the newer Google C++ Style.
Please refer to the _clang-format file in the root directory of the product for additional style information.
