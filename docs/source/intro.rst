.. GPU Performance API Introduction

Introduction
------------

The GPU Performance API (GPUPerfAPI, or GPA) is a powerful library to help
analyze the performance and execution characteristics of applications using
the GPU.

This API is designed to:

* Support Vulkan™, DirectX™ 12, DirectX 11, OpenGL, OpenCL™, and ROCm/HSA on
  GCN-based Radeon™ graphics cards and APUs.
* Support Microsoft Windows® and Linux®.
* Provide derived counters based on raw hardware performance counters.
* Provide a fine-grained way to collect performance data for an application.
