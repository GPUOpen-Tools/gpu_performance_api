GpaEndSample
@@@@@@@@@@@@

Syntax
%%%%%%

.. code-block:: c++

    GpaStatus GpaEndSample(
        GpaCommandListId command_list_id);

Description
%%%%%%%%%%%

Ends a sample in a command list. A sample is a particular workload for which
counters will be collected. If the owning session was created with
kGpaSessionSampleTypeDiscreteCounter and one or more counters have been
enabled, then those counters will be collected for this sample. Each sample
must be associated with a GPA command list. Samples can be created by using
multiple threads provided no two threads are creating samples on same command
list. You must provide a unique Id for every new sample. You may create as many
samples as needed. However, nesting of samples is not allowed. Each sample must
be wrapped in sequence of GpaBeginSample/GpaEndSample before starting another
one. A sample can be started in one primary command list and continued/ended on
another primary command list - See GpaContinueSampleOnCommandList.
