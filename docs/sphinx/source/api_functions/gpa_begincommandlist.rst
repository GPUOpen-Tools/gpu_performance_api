GpaBeginCommandList
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Syntax
%%%%%%

.. code-block:: c++

    GpaStatus GpaBeginCommandList(
        GpaSessionId session_id,
        GpaUInt32 pass_index,
        void* command_list,
        GpaCommandListType command_list_type,
        GpaCommandListId* command_list_id)

Description
%%%%%%%%%%%

Begins a command list for sampling. You will be unable to create samples on a
command list or command buffer before GpaBeginCommandList is called. The
session must have been previously created and started before starting a command
list. For multi-pass counter collection, you must call this function for each
command list once per pass.

Parameters

    "``session_id``","Unique identifier of a previously-created session."
    "``pass_index``", "The zero-based index of the pass."
    "``command_list``", "API-specific command list on which to begin sampling. For DirectX 12, this should be a ID3D12GraphicsCommandList. For Vulkan, this should be a vkCommandBuffer. For all other APIs, this should be kGpaCommandListNone."
    "``command_list_type``", "The type of the ``command_list`` parameter. For DirectX 12 and Vulkan, this should be either kGpaCommandListPrimary or kGpaCommandListSecondary. Secondary command lists are either bundles (DirectX 12) or secondary command buffer (Vulkan). For all other APIs, this should be kGpaCommandListNone."
    "``command_list_id``", "On successful execution of this function, this parameter will be set to a GPA-generated unique command list identifier. This value can subsequently passed to any GPA function taking a GpaCommandListId as an input parameter."
