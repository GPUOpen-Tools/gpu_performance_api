    GpaStatus GpaContinueSampleOnCommandList(

Description
%%%%%%%%%%%

Continues a sample from one primary command list on to another primary
command list. This function is only supported for DirectX 12 and Vulkan.
Normally samples must be started and ended on the same command list. Using this
function, samples can be started on one primary command list and continued/ended on
another primary command list, allowing a single sample to span more than one
command list.
