Syntax
%%%%%%

.. code-block:: c++

    GpaStatus GpaBeginSample(
        GpaUInt32 sample_id,
        GpaCommandListId command_list_id);

Description
%%%%%%%%%%%

Begins a sample in a command list. A sample is a particular workload for which
counters will be collected. If the owning session was created with
kGpaSessionSampleTypeDiscreteCounter and one or more counters have been
enabled, then those counters will be collected for this sample. Each sample
must be associated with a GPA command list. The command list must have been
previously started before starting a sample. Samples can be created by multiple
threads provided no two threads are creating samples on same command list. You
must provide a unique id for every new sample. When performing multiple passes,
every sample id must exist in every pass. You may create as many samples as
needed. However, nesting of samples is not allowed. Each sample must be wrapped
in sequence of GpaBeginSample/GpaEndSample before starting another one. A
sample can be started in one primary command list and continued/ended on
another primary command list - See GpaContinueSampleOnCommandList.
